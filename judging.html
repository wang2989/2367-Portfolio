          One of the best parts about being a Computer Science and Engineering
          major at Ohio State University is its massive community in both the
          university and the city of Columbus. I joined OHI/O to help expand the
          tech community at OSU and see the inspirational projects created by students.
          Our club organizes OSU’s official hackathons, such as HackOHI/O and MakeOHI/O,
          which provide students an opportunity to demonstrate their skills and
          passion and connect with industry representatives.

          In the organization, I coordinate project judging. This involves asking
          industry professionals to become judges, creating criteria to judge the
          teams on, planning the logistics of judging, and handling prizes. This past
          year, I’ve focused on developing a 2-stage judging process to award our
          prizes to teams in a more objective fashion. While there have been setbacks
          due to Covid-19, I’m always looking at how to improve our judging process
          so that participants feel motivated to compete. This upcoming Spring 2021 semester,
          I am also leading our annual MakeOHI/O event.
