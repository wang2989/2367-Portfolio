        Hi There. I'm Josh Wang, a student at Ohio State University studying
        Computer Science and Engineering.

      <div class="text content">
        I'm passionate about both tech and the tech community. After having fun
        coding projects with friends, I decided to study what I was interested in:
        creating software and designing UI/UX. I love to create well-designed and
        aesthetic visuals for content.

        It features what I hope to learn, how I hope to imrpove, and whay my goals
        are. Further on, I'll also be showcasing some projects and extracurriculars
        I've worked on.

      <h1>Career Goals</h1>
      <div class="text content">
        Currently, I'm looking forward for an internship as a front-end developer.
        During my free time, I've been learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and
        hope to apply them in a work environment. An internship is a great way
        to learn industry standard tools and workflow. My experience with cooperative
        efforts such as planning hackathons, familiarity with front-end languages,
        and passion for technology will help me quickly learn in an internship.
      </div>
      <div class="text content">
        In addition to the front-end experience gained in the internship, I will
        also be learning about back-end development. In the future, I plan to study
        about and create projects with popular back-end development tools such as
        Ruby on Rials, Node.js, or Django and eventually work as a full-stack
        developer. Obtaining an internship involving front-end development will
        aid in finding a full-stack career.
