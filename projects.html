      <h1>Fundamentals of Engineering Honors Robot</h1>
      <div class="text content">
        The Fundamentals of Engineering Honors (FEH) course at Ohio State 
        University involves creating a robot from scratch to navigate an obstacle 
        course. In the 2020 Spring semester, FEH students set out to build a robot 
        set in a diner-scenario. Obstacles required usto navigate the course 
        using line-tracking algorithms and GPS, recognize light colors using a 
        sensor, and work with unfamiliar hardware and software libraries.

        Within our group, I managed the development of our robot’s software and 
        subsequent algorithms. Algorithms developed by me included using our 
        robot’s light sensors to recognize whether it was on a black line and to 
        adjust accordingly based on the positioning of the line. This allowed 
        the robot to follow designated paths set by black lines. Additionally, 
        I created a program to manually change distance values and sensor 
        thresholds in our code to supplement faulty hardware that would’ve 
        allowed the same function.This drastically reduced our testing times 
        from 3-4hours to only 1.

      <h1>OHI/O Hackathon Judging Lead</h1>
      <div class="text content">
        One of the best parts about being a Computer Science and Engineering 
        major at Ohio State University is its massive community in both the 
        university and the city of Columbus. I joined OHI/O to help expand the 
        tech community at OSU and see the inspirational projects created by students. 
        Our club organizes OSU’s official hackathons, such as HackOHI/O and MakeOHI/O, 
        which provide students an opportunity to demonstrate their skills and 
        passion and connect with industry representatives.

      <div class="text content">
        In the organization, I coordinate project judging. This involves asking 
        industry professionals to become judges, creating criteria to judge the 
        teams on, planning the logistics of judging, and handling prizes. This past 
        year, I’ve focused on developing a 2-stage judging process to award our 
        prizes to teams in a more objective fashion. While there have been setbacks 
        due to Covid-19, I’m always looking at how to improve our judging process 
        so that participants feel motivated to compete. This upcoming Spring 2021 semester, 
        I am also leading our annual MakeOHI/O event.

      <h1>Judging Web Application</h1>
      <div class="text content">
        Judging is always a hectic and fast-paced process at OHI/O’s hackathons. 
        We must track numerous judges and teams in a short time span and ensure 
        that everything flows smoothly. To do so, the judging team has been working 
        to create a web application that will handle project data and score submissions 
        by judges. The backend was developed using Django and handles participant 
        information, team data, and judge information. I assisted in planning the 
        structure of our models and am currently working on creating the front-end. 
        Development of the pages includes creating a UI design and using JavaScript 
        to allow for judges to submit a form on the web application and add it to a team’s score.
