          Judging is always a hectic and fast-paced process at OHI/O’s hackathons.
          We must track numerous judges and teams in a short time span and ensure
          that everything flows smoothly. To do so, the judging team has been working
          to create a web application that will handle project data and score submissions
          by judges. The backend was developed using Django and handles participant
          information, team data, and judge information. I assisted in planning the
          structure of our models and am currently working on creating the front-end.
          Development of the pages includes creating a UI design and using JavaScript
          to allow for judges to submit a form on the web application and add it to a team’s score.
