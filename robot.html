          The Fundamentals of Engineering Honors (FEH) course at Ohio State
          University involves creating a robot from scratch to navigate an obstacle
          course. In the 2020 Spring semester, FEH students set out to build a robot
          set in a diner-scenario. Obstacles required us to navigate the course
          using line-tracking algorithms and GPS, recognize light colors using a
          sensor, and work with unfamiliar hardware and software libraries.

          Within our group, I managed the development of our robot’s software and
          subsequent algorithms. Algorithms developed by me included using our
          robot’s light sensors to recognize whether it was on a black line and to
          adjust accordingly based on the positioning of the line. This allowed
          the robot to follow designated paths set by black lines. Additionally,
          I created a program to manually change distance values and sensor
          thresholds in our code to supplement faulty hardware that would’ve
          allowed the same function.This drastically reduced our testing times
          from 3-4 hours to only 1.
